# CMPSC 100: Fall 2021, Rewind Sessions

This document serves as a guide to the Friday Rewind sessions. Groups should consult this as they plan a _minimum_ 15-minute presentation on the Fridays for which they are responsible. These dates are available via [the course schedule](https://chompe.rs/fa-2021-schedule).

Activities and solutions will be posted to this repository on a weekly basis. Ideally, your group should spend 1-2 hours working on this presentation.

## Point values

The instructor reserves the ability to penalize group members whose participation is demonstrably unacceptable.

## Requirements

Each group's session must contain the following:

* A summary of each of the different take-aways from the week's work
  * This can be done via slides or via white board illustration/demonstration
* A list of questions or requests (`2+`) which the group feels were unanswered or raised during the week's instruction
  * These could be practical questions or
  * Conceptual questions which push beyond what was discussed in class
* An incomplete example activity which the group designs in consultation with the instructor that focuses on what the group found most challenging during the week
  * This should focus on one or two concepts rather than _everything_ from a given week
  * The instructor will write this example
  * The questions or requests presented by the group may (and likely should guide this activity)
  * The group should aim to teach their solution to the class
* (Optionally) The group may choose to develop an analog activity. This would take the place of an incomplete example _or_ could complement/supplement it.

The presentations must be a minimum of `15 minutes`.

## Tips

* Your group should focus on surfacing what you perceive to be common questions around what you're discussing, as the service you provide to the class is one of amplifying areas which aren't quite clear yet
* Presentations are a best attempt to both summarize and clarify.
* Your group might want to schedule time to discuss your approach with the instructor. Appointments can occur during [office hours](https://chompe.rs/office-hours) or around various class times.
